[Resume](/data/resume/resume.pdf)

I am a software engineer with an obsession with innovation.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Parka Technology, and a Blockchain Engineer for Huskyshiba, 
where I helped with the creation of a parking management software, and gained some experience in unit testing. 

Outside of work, I've created over 30 different blockchain projects that have received over 5 million impressions.
I also help create websites, and am learning AI in my spare time.
