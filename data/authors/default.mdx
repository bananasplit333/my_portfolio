I am a software engineer with an obsession with innovation.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Parka Technology, and a Fullstack engineer for Huskyshiba,
where I helped with the creation of a parking management software, and gained some experience in unit testing.

In my spare time, I like playing basketball, and researching new innovations in AI to incorporate into my projects.
